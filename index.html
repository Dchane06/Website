          <h1>Hey! I'm Devan Chaney!!</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>I decided I wanted to build this site as a way for me to not only practice my skills with html, css and javascript; but also as a way for me to introduce myself to the world! Everyone has a website these days, right?? So on this website I will be showcasing various projects I'm working on, as well as completed projects.</p>
          <p>As a sidenote, I currently reside in the good ole' state of Kentucky. I work as a production worker and have loved technology/computing my entire life! This is just a small introduction, head on down to my 'About Me' section to learn more about myself! Have a great day =)!</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Coding has always been an interesting thing to me. My love of computers started when I was around 3-4 years old. Back then, in the mid nineties, computers were on the rise, my father was interested in computers in the early years of the nineties. Here and there I had been able to gain a glimpse into what computers could do for people and the world in general. This made me beg my parents to get me a computer when I was super young, and to my suprise, they did! Obviously though I wasn't allowed to be on the internet too much, so I mostly stuck to playing computer games like Sonic the Hedgehog and other games such as that. But from then on, computers became this wonderous thing in my life!</p>

      <p>In recent years, (1-2), I have become interested on coding and the deeper infrastructures on computers. I wanted to know what made them tick, and how I could possibly learn what those things were and use them to further my understanding of computers. I love discovering new things and picking apart puzzles to figure out how things work and how to better them! I know I'm still in the beginning stages of my progression, but I can't wait to see how technology advances and how I can further learn and help in the development of the future. Things such as front-end development, as well as the trickiness of back-end development are some of the things that I want to help with going forward. Working by myself or with a team of talented individuals to come up with various Javascript scripts to help output things on a front-end to better the customer experience. This is the future for me!</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding and I have free time away from my job, I enjoy playing video games, such as: Rocket League, Hearthstone, Valorant, etc. I also enjoy journaling and writing poetry from time to time to take my mind away from the world! I try my best to live as relaxed and at ease as possible, adopting some of the Buddhist teachings to try and consistently keep a level and clear head in my daily life. Meditation I have found does wonders for the brain and can help keep your soul connected to yourself and to the Earth that we're living on.</p>
